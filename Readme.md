# MultiplicationGame

This is the second challenge project of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge)). The goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on.

As with other challenge projects, there will be no extra challenges at the end.
